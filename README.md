## 2.What is the width of a container with 100px of width and 5px of padding?

Without the CSS box-sizing property the padding will be added to the visible width of the container, making it 110px.
But the box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height, totalizing the same initial 100px.

## 3.How to apply a click event to all paragraphs except for the last?

You can use the not() selector to apply an event to all elements except the specified one.
$("p:not(.lastOne)").onclick = function()

## 4.Why does the alert show "Jack" first and then undefined?

It’s returning undefined because is a default Javascript behavior to close a statement automatically at the end of a line. That means you cannot break the line between “return” and “name”.
